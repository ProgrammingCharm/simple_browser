Simple browser built with Python's QWebEngine. This is the main program that calls four other microservices - microservices that work indepently of the main program. The main program has very basic browser capabilities and the microservices it will call are more specific. An emphasis on inclusivity heuristics and usability, I implemented this using a sprint framework. The main program supports a graphical user interface that allows users to load the contents of specific URLs. It has basic error handling for improper or invalid URLs. It also allows a user to refresh a page, go back, and move forward in their navigation. It loads lightweight web pages of one megabyte within one second on average.
